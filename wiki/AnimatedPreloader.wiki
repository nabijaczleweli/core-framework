#summary SVG/VML Animated Preloader

= Introduction =

Core Framework provides handy cross-browser animated preloader. It can be placed inside any container: div, span etc. 

= Why use it ? = 
Usually one uses animated *.gif* files for preloading indication. However *.gif* format has poor transparency support and when placed over gradients or images, the quality is very low.

Also, sometimes preloaders need to be flexible, bigger, customizable etc.

Imagine to have all these features without image at all. Core Framework provides SVG/VML base preloader, with full transparency support, fully customizable and platform independent.

= Features =
  # SVG/VML based
  # Full transparency support
  # Adjustable speed
  # Adjustable size
  # Adjustable number of elements
  # Adjustable radius of elements
  # Controllable by JS ( stop(), play(), pause() etc )
  # Recommended for AJAX based applications

= How to use? =

{
	size: 		20, /* Radius of dots */
	radius: 	30, /* Radius of preloader */
	opacity: 	1, /* Opacity of preloader */
	speed: 		2, /* Animation speed */
	points: 	7, /* Number of points in preloader */
	renderTo: 	'.canvas' /* Element where preloader will be rendered */
});
