#summary SVG/VML Animated Preloader

= Introduction =

Core Framework provides handy cross-browser animated preloader. It can be placed inside any container: div, span etc. 

= Why use it ? = 
Usually developers use animated *.gif* files. However *.gif* has poor transparency support and when placed over gradients or images, the quality is very low.

= How to use? =

{{{
Core.draw.init().loader(
{
	size: 		20, /* Radius of dots */
	radius: 	30, /* Radius of preloader */
	opacity: 	1, /* Opacity of preloader */
	speed: 		2, /* Animation speed */
	points: 	7, /* Number of points in preloader */
	renderTo: 	'.canvas' /* Element where preloader will be rendered */
});
