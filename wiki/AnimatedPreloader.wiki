#summary SVG/VML Animated Preloader

= Introduction =

Core Framework provides handy cross-browser animated preloader. It can be placed inside any container: div, span etc. 

= The problem = 
Usually one uses animated *.gif* files for preloading indication. However *.gif* format has poor transparency support and when placed over gradients or images, the quality is very low.

Also, sometimes preloaders need to be flexible, bigger, customizable etc.

= The solution =
Imagine to have all these features without image at all. Core Framework provides SVG/VML base preloader, with full transparency support, fully customizable and platform independent.

= Features =
  # SVG/VML based
  # Full transparency support
  # Adjustable speed
  # Adjustable size
  # Adjustable number of elements
  # Adjustable radius of elements
  # Controllable by JS ( stop(), play(), pause() etc )
  # Recommended for AJAX based applications
