  # Namespace definition
  # Class definition
  # Class inheritance

  # Autoload
  # Mixins

= Why use it? =
Core Framework relies on jQuery to work. One may find it strange to use 2 frameworks in a site and may really have a point. However, CF is specially designed to work alongside with jQuery and here are the benefits that you should take into account when deciding to use it or not:

  # it is lightweight (less than 3kb minified and gzipped)
  # it solves the most frequent tasks related to project development
    * Loads resources (scripts, css, images) on demand
    * Provides standard support for OOP, allowing for development of extensible classes and objects
    * Enables delegation
    * Provides number of tools
    * Makes preloading easy
    * Utilizes some of the fastest algorithms to provide snappy response times
  # it is optimized for best performance
  # it is supported and extended by company (Creozon Ltd.) working in the field of UI and User Experience.
