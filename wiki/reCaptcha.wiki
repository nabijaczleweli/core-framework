#summary Install reCaptcha with Core Framework

= Introduction =

reCAPTCHA is a free CAPTCHA service that helps to digitize books, newspapers and old time radio shows. Check out our paper in Science about it (or read more below).

A CAPTCHA is a program that can tell whether its user is a human or a computer. You've probably seen them â€” colorful images with distorted text at the bottom of Web registration forms. CAPTCHAs are used by many websites to prevent abuse from "bots," or automated programs usually written to generate spam. No computer program can read distorted text as well as humans can, so bots cannot navigate sites protected by CAPTCHAs.


= Install with Core Framework =

Core Framework allows you to install reCaptcha with a single line of code:
{{{
Core.require('plugins.captcha', function()
{
	Captcha.config(
	{
		key: '<your public key here>'
	}).create("captcha",
	{
		theme: "red"
	});
})
}}}
