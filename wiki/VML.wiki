#summary SVG/VML Support in Core Framework

= Introduction = 
If you are here, you probably already know that SVG is supported by most modern browser incl. Internet Explorer 9. However it's not supported in Internet Explorer 6,7 and 8. Statistics show that the almost 60% of the people use Internet Explorer, and 50% of them use version lower than 9. This means that even deprecated, VML is still the only option to achieve cross-browser vector graphic.

If you are here you also probably know that SVG translates to VML with few exceptions.
