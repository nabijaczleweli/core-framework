#summary Speeding up your application

= Introduction =

Core Framework provides means for dynamic script inclusion and one can make use of this to speed up an application.

In a trivial situation most of the scripts are included in the *head* section. However sometimes a script may never do a task depending on the purpose of the user visit. (Example: User may look at the site, but not login to update his/her profile. Imagine that authorization is done via ajax and some functions are needed to properly handle the login process)
