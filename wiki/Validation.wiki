#summary Form validation with Core Framework

= Form validation =

Most of the user interaction is done via web forms. Core Framework provides robust mechanism for form validation that can be applied to every form in every project (even existing forms)

= Details =

Form validation is done through a process called mapping:

{{{
var maps = /* Validation map(s) */
{
	login: 
	{
		username: 
		{
			required: true, 
			email: 	  true,
			message:  "Username must be valid email address"
		}
	}
}
}}}

Mapping is a simple process of creating a JSON map with the fields that need to be validated. One can validate multiple forms with single map. 

= Map format =

{{{
<form id>: {
	<field>:
	{
		required: <true>|<false>,
		message: <error message>,
		<validator>: <result>,
		<validator>: <result>
		...
		...
		...
	}
}
}}}
